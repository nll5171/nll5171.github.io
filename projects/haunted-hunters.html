                    <p class="pt-2">Haunted Hunters was a Unity project developed in a group of 3 during my Junior year
                        in RIT’s Game Design & Development program, and was created for the Casual Game Development
                        class I took during the latter half of the academic year.</p>
                    <p>Since the goal was to create a game targeted towards more casual audiences, one focused on short
                        play sessions, we decided to create an endless runner game in a similar vein to Jetpack Joyride
                        and Subway Surfers.</p>
                    <p>Our game involves avoiding enemies and obstacles by switching between the 3 available lanes open
                        to the player. Yellow collectibles are spawned randomly alongside obstacles and enemies that
                        serve as ammunition that can be fired at enemies and obstacles to destroy them.</p>
                    <p>The game would progressively increase in speed the further along you went, in order to ramp up
                        the difficulty and keep things interesting. We also included the ability to begin at a faster
                        speed right off the bat, providing an increased score modifier based on your starting speed to
                        compensate for the higher starting difficulty.</p>
                    <!-- <p>Overall, the project was kept quite simple in scope due to all of us struggling with heavy
                        amounts of work in our other classes. The core gameplay loop did not change from what we had
                        initially designed, though we did make several adjustments to player movement, scoring, and
                        obstacle spawning based on player feedback.</p>
                    <p>Our largest difficulty with this project was time management, where each of us struggled to find
                        the opportunity to get this project done outside of the few hours we were all free to meet,
                        which didn’t give us a lot of time to discuss changes before our sprints.</p>
                    <p>We also ran into a lot of trouble with making the movement feel good, as we intended to have a
                        delay between switching lanes from the player character jumping/falling between them. Despite
                        our several attempts, we couldn’t find a speed (fixed or responsive) that felt great to players,
                        and shifted to switching lanes instantly towards the tail end of the project.</p> -->
                    <p>I was primarily responsible for the game loop, player movement, speed adjustment, scoring, and
                        later went on to revise the system we had for spawning to adjust the percentage chances for
                        objects spawned as the distance traveled increased, in another attempt to increase the
                        difficulty.</p>
