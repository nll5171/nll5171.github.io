                    <p class="pt-2">This was a romhack of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future I created in
                        the fall of 2021 prior to my start at RIT. The Roman Cancel is a technique from the Guilty Gear
                        series of fighting games in which an individual can spend resources to cancel one of their
                        actions and return to an actionable state. As a fan of that series, I wanted to see if I would
                        be able to recreate that mechanic within this game.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">To achieve this, I utilized a debugging tool to trace through the game’s subroutines
                        in order to find one that was capable of returning the player to a neutral state, and the
                        requirements for the player to be considered in one. Likewise, I also needed to find the
                        subroutines responsible for playing sound effects and displaying visual effects on screen, in
                        order to provide visual and auditory feedback.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">With the preliminary research completed, I then proceeded to jump to empty ROM space
                        and inject custom assembly in the routine that normally begins with the check for special move
                        inputs. I rerouted the instruction to jump to that routine to instead go towards my custom
                        assembly, then the special move input routine afterwards, before finally returning to where it
                        was initially.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">I ran into a few issues during this process that required some additional work. This
                        game allows you to switch between two states at will: Stand On and Stand Off, which change the
                        attacks you're able to perform, as well as some of your movement options. While my initial code
                        worked for the Stand Off state, it did not work for the Stand On state. As such, I needed to
                        write additional custom assembly to have it work for both.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">The end result is a little buggy, as the game was never designed around being able
                        to do this, but for the most part, it functions as intended. I was even able to get the romhack
                        to have its own lobby on FightCade, a software client to play arcade titles online using
                        rollback netcode.</p>
