                        This video was not only an in-depth investigation into the mechanics of building meter in Under
                        Night In-Birth, but also my attempt to learn DaVinci resolve, having recently upgraded to a
                        computer that could handle the software. In the past I had used Adobe Premiere and After
                        Effects, but was eager to switch to something that I wouldn't need to pay for (or be lucky
                        enough to use through my part-time job with RIT).
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2">Research for this video was also substantially more difficult, as while most of the
                        game's code is still available in the high-level language it was written in (Squirrel), some of
                        what I needed access to was stored directly in the executable rather than in separate bin files.
                        As such, I needed to dust off my debugging skills, this time with Ghidra rather than Mame.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">The researching stage took quite a bit longer than I would've hoped, as did the
                        scriptwriting phase. I believe I began towards the start of 2025, but didn't finish the research
                        until around March, and didn't finish the scriptwriting until around late April.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">Despite learning DaVinci resolve for the first time, I was able to get the hang of
                        things quite quickly, and, after having used it, I don't feel any need to go back to Adobe.
                        Additionally, I was able to iterate on what I had done in the prior video on Under Night,
                        increasing the time text was shown on-screen, and ensuring it was always properly centered, as I
                        had been neglectful of that before.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">Said process required me to learn a fair bit about fuses, and having spent time
                        learning it, I'm confident I'd be able to accomplish far more with DaVinci resolve than I ever
                        could with Premiere. I'm proud to have made this video, and I hope to continue making future
                        videos in DaVinci resolve as well.</p>
