                        This video was designed as a thorough analysis of the changes made to the character of Hyde in
                        Under Night In-Birth, and more specifically, his heavy dashing attack (referred to as 66C in the
                        game's notation).
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2">I had become more and more intested in Under Night In-Birth over time and with the
                        release of the much anticipated sequel in early 2024, I decided I wanted to make a video about
                        the game. At the time however, I wasn't sure what the topic would be.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">Eventually, in an unrelated matter, I had gained access to the character data for
                        every revision of the game since 2012, from the first game and all its updates, to the sequel.
                        In doing so, I was able to investigate how moves changed, and I was particularly interested in
                        how Hyde's 66C changed, since it's one of his strongest tools and has been since the beginning.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2">To differentiate these videos from the JoJo's videos I had created prior, I decided
                        to forgo voice-over and instead used on-screen text. In the hopes of making it flow better with
                        the video, I synced up the text to appear with the measures of the music playing in the
                        background. Since I was listening to the Ridge Racer and Daytona soundtracks at the time, I used
                        music from those games for this video.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">Overall, the video was difficult to produce (since it had been a bit since I had
                        last edited a video), but I was able to get back into the swing of things relatively quickly.
                        The video wasn't perfect, but I was proud nonetheless, and figured whatever project I did next
                        for the game, I'd be able to improve on the foundation laid here.</p>
