                    <p class="pt-2">During my co-op with the Golisano College of Computing & Information Sciences, this
                        was the project I was tasked with working on developing. I collaborated in a small team of 5 to
                        create a fullstack web application using a React front-end and a SQL back-end. The goal was to
                        create a place for students to post about and keep up-to-date on, student led projects, whether
                        personal or academic.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">Our team was managed via Agile methodologies, more specifically Scrum, and progress
                        was handled through Trello. Though we usually took whatever tasks were considered most pressing,
                        I generally focused on making the site responsive to mobile devices, as well as implementing
                        several key components like search functionality by text and by the filters/tags system that was
                        devised prior to my arrival on the project.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">I also implemented the dark theme for the site (and the ability to transition
                        between themes), settings page design and functionality, and numerous other touch-ups and minor
                        additions based on the Design Tokens we had.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">While progress was generally smooth, we ran into some issues throughout, notably
                        with two things: Create-React-App and login system migration.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">Create-React-App, our build tool at the time, was deprecated midway through my time
                        on the project. While we were able to switch to the Vue.js framework with little trouble
                        overall, it was still a roadblock in our development timeline.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">More notably however, was the issue concerning login system migration, something
                        that came at the tail-end of development that I was no longer around to assist with. We had
                        previously been using a proprietary login system, but we were given the opportunity to host the
                        site through RIT and needed to make changes in order to do so. The primary one was the changing
                        of the login system from our proprietary one, to using Shibboleth. We began our research into
                        the process and started planning the implementation and changes necessary to make it work, but
                        with this coming so late into my time working on the project, we were unable to get it done
                        before then, and work on it has continued since. I'm unsure what progress on it is currently
                        like however, as I haven't really been keeping up with the project. I can only hope it's doing
                        well however.</p>
